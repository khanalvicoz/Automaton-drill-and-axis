Linear Axis States (5 States):
S1: 𝑥=50 mm
S2: x=100 mm
S3: x=500 mm
S4: x=550 mm
Danger State: x<50 mm or x>550 mm
Advantages of This Approach:
Simplifies the Model: Fewer states make the automaton easier to implement and manage.
Ensures Safety: The "Danger" state captures any position outside the safe working range.
Logical Transitions: Moving between these key states covers critical scenarios without unnecessary complexity.

Combined with the 2 drill tool states (ON/OFF), we’ll have 10 possible system states.

The guidelines given on exercises were followed, debugging still necessary.
